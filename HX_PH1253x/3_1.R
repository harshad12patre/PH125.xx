#Exercise1:An American roulette wheel has 18 red, 18 black, and 2 green pockets. Each red and black pocket is associated with a number from 1 to 36. The two remaining green slots feature "0" and "00". Players place bets on which pocket they think a ball will land in after the wheel is spun. Players can bet on a specific number (0, 00, 1-36) or color (red, black, or green).

#What are the chances that the ball lands in a green pocket?
# The variables `green`, `black`, and `red` contain the number of pockets for each color
green <- 2
black <- 18
red <- 18

# Assign a variable `p_green` as the probability of the ball landing in a green pocket
p_green = green/(green+black+red)

# Print the variable `p_green` to the console
p_green


#Exercise2:In American roulette, the payout for winning on green is $17. This means that if you bet $1 and it lands on green, you get $17 as a prize.

#Create a model to predict your winnings from betting on green.

# Use the `set.seed` function to make sure your answer matches the expected result after random sampling.
set.seed(1)

# The variables 'green', 'black', and 'red' contain the number of pockets for each color
green <- 2
black <- 18
red <- 18

# Assign a variable `p_green` as the probability of the ball landing in a green pocket
p_green <- green / (green+black+red)

# Assign a variable `p_not_green` as the probability of the ball not landing in a green pocket
p_not_green <- 1-p_green

# Create a model to predict the random variable `X`, your winnings from betting on green. Sample one time.
X <- sample(c(17,-1), 1, prob = c(p_green, p_not_green))

# Print the value of `X` to the console
X



#Exercise3:In American roulette, the payout for winning on green is $17. This means that if you bet $1 and it lands on green, you get $17 as a prize.In the previous exercise, you created a model to predict your winnings from betting on green.

#Now, compute the expected value of X, the random variable you generated previously.

# The variables 'green', 'black', and 'red' contain the number of pockets for each color
green <- 2
black <- 18
red <- 18

# Assign a variable `p_green` as the probability of the ball landing in a green pocket
p_green <- green / (green+black+red)

# Assign a variable `p_not_green` as the probability of the ball not landing in a green pocket
p_not_green <- 1-p_green

# Calculate the expected outcome if you win $17 if the ball lands on green and you lose $1 if the ball doesn't land on green
p_green * 17 + p_not_green * -1



#Exercise4:The standard error of a random variable X tells us the difference between a random variable and its expected value. You calculated a random variable X in exercise 2 and the expected value of that random variable in exercise 3.

#Now, compute the standard error of that random variable, which represents a single outcome after one spin of the roulette wheel.

# The variables 'green', 'black', and 'red' contain the number of pockets for each color
green <- 2
black <- 18
red <- 18

# Assign a variable `p_green` as the probability of the ball landing in a green pocket
p_green <- green / (green+black+red)

# Assign a variable `p_not_green` as the probability of the ball not landing in a green pocket
p_not_green <- 1-p_green

# Compute the standard error of the random variable
abs((17 - -1))*sqrt(p_green*p_not_green)




#Exercise5:You modeled the outcome of a single spin of the roulette wheel, X, in exercise 2.

#Now create a random variable S that sums your winnings after betting on green 1,000 times.

# The variables 'green', 'black', and 'red' contain the number of pockets for each color
green <- 2
black <- 18
red <- 18

# Assign a variable `p_green` as the probability of the ball landing in a green pocket
p_green <- green / (green+black+red)

# Assign a variable `p_not_green` as the probability of the ball not landing in a green pocket
p_not_green <- 1-p_green

# Use the `set.seed` function to make sure your answer matches the expected result after random sampling
set.seed(1)

# Define the number of bets using the variable 'n'
n <- 1000

# Create a vector called 'X' that contains the outcomes of 1000 samples
X <- sample(c(17,-1), size = n, replace=TRUE, prob=c(p_green, p_not_green))

# Assign the sum of all 1000 outcomes to the variable 'S'
S <- sum(X)

# Print the value of 'S' to the console
S


#Exercise6:In the previous exercise, you generated a vector of random outcomes, S, after betting on green 1,000 times.

#What is the expected value of S?
  
  # The variables 'green', 'black', and 'red' contain the number of pockets for each color
  green <- 2
black <- 18
red <- 18

# Assign a variable `p_green` as the probability of the ball landing in a green pocket
p_green <- green / (green+black+red)

# Assign a variable `p_not_green` as the probability of the ball not landing in a green pocket
p_not_green <- 1-p_green

# Define the number of bets using the variable 'n'
n <- 1000

# Calculate the expected outcome of 1,000 spins if you win $17 when the ball lands on green and you lose $1 when the ball doesn't land on green
n * (p_green * 17 + p_not_green * -1)


#Exercise7:You generated the expected value of S, the outcomes of 1,000 bets that the ball lands in the green pocket, in the previous exercise.

#What is the standard error of S?
  
  # The variables 'green', 'black', and 'red' contain the number of pockets for each color
  green <- 2
black <- 18
red <- 18

# Assign a variable `p_green` as the probability of the ball landing in a green pocket
p_green <- green / (green+black+red)

# Assign a variable `p_not_green` as the probability of the ball not landing in a green pocket
p_not_green <- 1-p_green

# Define the number of bets using the variable 'n'
n <- 1000

# Compute the standard error of the sum of 1,000 outcomes
sqrt(n) * abs((17 + 1))*sqrt(p_green*p_not_green)
